In the middle of the night
When our hopes and fears collide
 
In the midst of all goodbyes
 
Where all human beings lie
 
Against another lie
 
Whisper broken promises
 
There we hide
 
Try to make it seem alright
 
What goes around again
 
We'd be running from the pain
 
Finding shelter in the rain
 
Lovers straying seasons changing
 
Strangers to lovers
 
What comes around again
 
You'd fall asleep in my embrace
 
Steal a kiss on your little face
 
Would have always been that way
 
But hey
 
You're never coming back
 
Never coming back
 
I'll be waiting anyway
 
I'll be waiting anyway
 
Until the day
